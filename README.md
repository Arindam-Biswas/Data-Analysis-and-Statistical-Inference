The second phase of the project is the actual analysis and write-up.

You will answer the research question you have developed using the dataset you chose as part of the first peer assessment, use exploratory and inferential methods and techniques we learn in this class to answer your research question, and summarize your findings into a report. Your goal is to submit a completely reproducible project that conveys that you have mastered statistical inference techniques that we have learned in class and that help you answer your research question.

Your project should be a write-up of Parts 1 - 5 below in the form of a research paper. Your proposal should be written using R Markdown, so that all R code, output, and plots will be automatically included in your write up. The R Markdown template and instructions can be found on the project page.

Your write-up should be at most seven pages (including figures and R code/output, excluding references and the appendix). This is not very long, so you will need to be concise. Every sentence should add meaning to your paper.

Submit one file which contains your data analysis project. The write-up should include the answers to all of the questions listed below, but should be formatted as a cohesive write-up instead of as bullet point list of questions and answers. While there are boxes beneath each of the specific evaluation criteria, you should not enter your answers in these boxes, but instead submit your write-up in one document as an attachment.

To submit the assignment:

    Knit the RMarkdown file to HTML. This will create an HTML file in your working directory.
    Use the Attach a File button under the submission text box to upload this HTML file to Coursera.

Please make sure you have addressed all of the evaluation criteria listed below.
